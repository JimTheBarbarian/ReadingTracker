# ReadingTracker
This is my attempt to stay accountable regarding my reading and have an overview at the end of the year. The current plan as of now is :

Frontend: React 
Backend: FastAPI
Database: PostgreSQL
ORM: SQLAlchemy 

Much will have been borrowed from https://github.com/fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template
